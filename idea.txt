/*HOW DO WE PLAY THE SUDOKU GAME*/
1. We have infront of us a 9x9 matrix
2. Further divided into 3x3 sub-matrices
3. Then some of the boxes have some numbers
4. We search for the number to fill in the boxes
5. This is how we play the game

/*HOW DO WE SEARCH FOR THE NUMBERS*/
1. We check the rows for missing numbers
2. We then check the column for the missing numbers
3. We then check the box of for the missing numbers
4. Then we take into account all the probable numbers that could fill a particular box
5. If the number of probable numbers is one we input the number into the box and repeat from Step - 1
