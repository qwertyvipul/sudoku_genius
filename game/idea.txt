/*HOW DO WE PLAY THE SUDOKU GAME*/
1. We have infront of us a 9x9 matrix
2. Further divided into 3x3 sub-matrices
3. Then some of the boxes have some numbers
4. We search for the number to fill in the boxes
5. This is how we play the game

/*HOW DO WE SEARCH FOR THE NUMBERS*/
1. We check the rows for missing numbers
2. We then check the column for the missing numbers
3. We then check the box of for the missing numbers
4. Then we take into account all the probable numbers that could fill a particular box
5. If the number of probable numbers is one we input the number into the box and repeat from Step - 1

/*HOW THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO WORK*/
1. We are going to give the program an integer array of 81 numbers separated by commas
	-> Using array for faster access
2. If the number is 0 it is an unfilled box otherwise it is filled with the given number
3. Now we will create a linked list for unfilled links
	-> Using linked list for improved traversals
	i. index number
	ii. next link
	iii. probability list link
		-> probable data
		-> next link
	iv. filed row link
	v. 
4. We will traverse the unfilled link list over and over and -
	1. Remove the un-probable values from probability link
	2. If number of probable value = 1 insert into the sudoko matrix
